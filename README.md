# EmmCube

A HyperCube based custom CAM Post-Processor for Fusion 360
- Creates a more suitable GCODE files for "Laser Cutters" built from 3D printers
  - Specifically for those with the laser diode jury-rigged to listen to TTL output from an Ender 3's fan PWM port (Make sure you don't over-volt your TTL line!)
- Includes features like multiple passes over sections for better cutting
- Supports Marlin firmware
- Really, this is primarily for personal use 
- Nearly documentation-less
